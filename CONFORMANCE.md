# CONFORMANCE

Every registered ID has one generated projection here, one scenario, and
at least one executed test whose name ends in the normalized ID.

The three honesty levels (R2):

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `some-true` | A fact reproduced from an authority. **Not established here.** |
| `build` | Constructed here and validated against its oracle. Evidence, not a proof. |
| `open` | Measured and reported. **Never asserted.** |

## reproducibility

| ID | Level | Statement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UC-REP-01` | `build` | Source-derived charter projections and complete LexLean build and verification artifacts are byte-identical across clean absolute roots under the locked SDK. |
| `UC-REP-02` | `build` | Dependency and execution-boundary failures are explicit and planted SDK-lock, source-lock, adjacent-checkout, and host-PATH fallbacks are rejected. |

## source-authority

| ID | Level | Statement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UC-CHR-01` | `build` | UORC charter, claim-boundary, evidence-boundary, and research-position records are accepted by the locked LexLean project and generate the committed project documentation projections. |
| `UC-CHR-02` | `build` | Handwritten project prose cannot define a second UORC specification or BCP-14 semantic rule, while non-authoritative evidence and planning prose remain permitted. |
| `UC-PERF-01` | `open` | measured public-corpus compression improvement, with exact target and scope; open until actually measured |
| `UC-REC-01` | `open` | externally accepted compression record; open unless the external authority actually accepts it |
